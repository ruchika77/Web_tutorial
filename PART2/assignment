Create a file index.html.
Inside of it, put a button in the middle [vertical and horizontal] of the page. Have the button say "Advance!".
Bellow the button [horizontally centered] have a paragraph reading "Using HTML and CSS moves the web forward!", with an id of "content".

Create a file helpers.js
Create a file script.js.
Include both files in the html page.

Inside the helper.js:

Define a function called "getPrefixedMessanger" that has a single parameter = "text".
getPrefixedMessanger should return another function.
The inner function should have a local variable "moreText" with a value " moves the web forward!". The inner function should return the argument of the first one prepended to the inner variable.

Inside the script.js

Declare a variable message.
Create a variable "prefix" with a value of "Javascript"
Create a variable "messanger" with a value the result of calling getPrefixedMessanger with prefix.
Initialise the message variable with a value the result of calling "messanger"
Create a function showMessage, that when called, finds the element on the page with the id of "content", and changes its content to be the value held by the 'message' variable.


Make clicking the button inside the index.html call "showMessage".


If everything works properly, after clicking the button, you should see "Javascript moves the web forward!"
