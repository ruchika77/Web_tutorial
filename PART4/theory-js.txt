What is a global variable?
    Variables are declared anywhere in the function are called global variables.
    There scope is not limited.
    
What is a local variable?
    Variables which are declared inside the function those are called local variable.
    There scope is limited only inside the closed braces.


What is closure?
    Closure is {} curly braces which means any variable defined in function can be enclosed in closure.


Provide an example of a closure

eg:1
    var x=1
    function display(){
        console.log(x)
    }

eg:2
    function display(){
        var x=2
        console.log(x)
    }

In eg 1 x is global variable and eg 2 x is local variable

What will this return:

var a = 1
function myFunc() {
	var a;
	return a;
}
console.log(myFunc())

// Answer : undefined as a is declared twice. So, the one declared inside the function will be call and there is no value assigned to it so, it will print undefined
